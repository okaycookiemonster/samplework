        <h1>THE UNTITLED PRINCESS</h1>
        
        <p>The morning birds chirping are heard out in this urban jungle. A 100 points in figuring out where exactly the birds are chirping; unless you are unaware, that melodious voice belongs not to a figurative blackbird but to a small tiny being that is well enough not living.</p>
        
        <p>You guessed right, that sound is from my mobile which was set up to disturb my relaxing phase. If you thought that ought to be the end of torture in the morning, you are highly mistaken. A plastic spider is thrown at me and soon the house rings out with my shrill scream, waking all the 144 members from their deary slumber.</p>

        <p>Walking out of my princess-like room as my mother likes to say, I began dressing up in the room of veteran warriors whose images have been slung over on a metal nail, with their big smiles and deary eyes reflecting the magic of war and the pain of being alone.</p>

        <blockquote>This room has been isolated ever since due to the fact that it is cold and uninviting. Mind you, watch that step over by the creaky stairs; it was claimed that my great grandfather was murdered and stuffed there; as if any of it has the least sense in actualism.</blockquote>

        <p>This room proves to be the perfect place to hide all my clothes; not just any clothes Mind You; This ought to be divinity for a shopaholic with <b>J. Choos</b>, <b>P. Bags</b> and 1000 pairs of Sneakers belonging to various brands, primarily <b>A.</b></p>

        <p>What is our morning routine? Basically get up, pray, sing the family anthem, drink the horse-shit coffee, and head to work. Not just any work, but the Family business we like to call <b>Positive</b>.</p>

        <h2>THE BUSINESS</h2>

        <p>We are the richest wedding planners in the World or we weren't as so much cause my grandfather and his wife ran this business into a total loss. It took a year to revive this so-called business and hence the control issues began.</p>

        <p>"This is the 7th wedding we are planning for <b>Vanessa</b>. Is she fooling around or is she really going to marry this man?" <b>Emily</b>, my secretary begins rambling at a speed of 100 words per minute.</p>

        <h2>THE HOSPITAL</h2>

        <p>I watch Em rush off while I head off to <b>Rhodes Hospital</b>. Vanessa V., my childhood bully. Poor girl, I pity her. She's a snobbish I-don't-care-who-the-fuck-you-are-vibist person who organized her wedding with around 6 of the top billionaires. Those 6 lucky billionaires are now happily married to my cousins... well, <b>Guilty As Charged</b>.</p>

        <p>On the way, I stop for an espresso and rush off like fire. The first patient seems to be a man who shot his girlfriend cause she didn't want to marry him but the bullet rebounded and well he's critical.</p>

        <p>"ARE YOU SERIOUS? DO I HAVE TO REMIND YOU NO COFFEE IN THE OPERATING THEATER? GET OUT." <b>Harry</b> shouts and the staff at call begin giggling.</p>

        <div class="flashback">
            <h3>FLASHBACK</h3>
            <p>I walk towards <b>Damien</b>, his deep blue eyes searching solace in mine. He complains of the cold snow and the warm rain; claiming it had no match in this unprecedented climate. He wanted me to leave the business in hand and join him in the army as an army surgeon. The last "I LOVE YOU" broke my heart till i could hear nothing but silence and absolute silence.</p>
        </div>

        <p>"I will handle it; Don't you worry." Harry concludes and i soon begin to fade away into the surreal silence of the hospital. That moment never faded.</p>
