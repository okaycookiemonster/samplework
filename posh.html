        <h1>The Untitled Princess</h1>
        
        <p>The morning birds are chirping in this urban jungle. A hundred points for figuring out where exactly they are; unless you are unaware, that melodious voice belongs not to a figurative blackbird but to a tiny being that is quite literally not living.</p>
        
        <p>You guessed right: that sound is from my mobile, set up specifically to disturb my relaxing phase. If you thought that was the end of the morning torture, you are highly mistaken. A plastic spider is launched at me and soon the house rings out with my shrill scream, waking all 144 members from their dreary slumber. Soon, even the youngest member—barely twelve—begins cussing.</p>

        <p>That would be my brother, who was born on my 20th birthday by accident. Not really, just saying. Walking out of my "princess-like" room, as my mother likes to call it, I begin dressing in the room of veteran warriors whose images hang from metal nails. Their big smiles and dreary eyes reflect the magic of war and the pain of being alone.</p>

        <blockquote>This room has been isolated ever since due to the fact that it is cold and uninviting. Mind you, watch your step by the creaky stairs; it is claimed that my great-grandfather was murdered and stuffed there—as if any of it has the least bit of sense in reality.</blockquote>

        <p>This room proves to be the perfect place to hide all my clothes. Not just any clothes, mind you; this is divinity for a shopaholic. **Jimmy Choos**, **Prada** bags, and a thousand pairs of sneakers belonging to various brands—primarily **Adidas**.</p>

        <p>What is our morning routine? Basically: get up, pray, sing the family anthem, drink the horse-shit coffee, and head to work. Not just any work, but the family business we like to call **Positive**. It wasn't supposed to be named that, but after various copyright issues, it sounded… well, perfect.</p>

        <p>Who am I? Just an untitled princess of Princetopia named after the first Lady of our house, **C.E.V.K.K.M.S.** And unfortunately, I am the CEO of this humble business my family works for.</p>

        <h2>The Business of Vows</h2>

        <p>We are the richest wedding planners in the world—or we weren't for a while, because my grandfather and his wife ran the business into a total loss. It took a year to revive the company, and hence, the control issues began.</p>

        <p>"This is the seventh wedding we are planning for **V——**," **E——**, my secretary, begins rambling at a speed of a hundred words per minute. "Is she fooling around, or is she really going to marry this man?"</p>

        <p>"Listen, **E——**, if she wants it, we do it. But charge her twice the normal fee and tell her the remuneration is 30,000 Euros if she cancels. Also, don't forget to mention that the wedding will be performed by her selected priest and I have zero interference."</p>

        <h2>The Hospital</h2>

        <p>I watch **E——** rush off to headquarters to draw up the contract while I head to **Rhodes Hospital**. **V——**, my childhood bully—or as she would say, "The Hottest Rhodes High Model." Poor girl, I pity her. She’s a snobbish, "I-don't-care-who-the-f-you-are" person who organized weddings with six different billionaires. Those six lucky billionaires are now happily married to my cousins and have beautiful families. Guilty as charged.</p>

        <p>On the way, I stop for an espresso and rush off like fire. The first patient is a man who shot his girlfriend because she didn't want to marry him, but the bullet rebounded and now he’s critical. Without waiting, I walk into the operating theater with my espresso in hand. Oopsie. By the time I realize… it’s too late.</p>

        <p>"ARE YOU SERIOUS? DO I HAVE TO REMIND YOU: NO COFFEE IN THE OPERATING THEATER? GET OUT!" **H——** shouts, and the staff on call begin giggling.</p>

        <p>I quickly dispose of the coffee and walk to him. "What’s the matter?" I ask. "Chances of survival are 20% and the bullet is attached to the frontal lobe. He's lucky to have survived this long, but I can't guarantee the next twenty minutes," he says.</p>

        <p>The medical file lies on the table. When I open it, I see horrific things. Things that make me remember that day. That unfaithful day when *his* body lay on the operating table and there was nothing I could do. Except to watch death take my beloved betrothed away into celestial existence.</p>

        <div class="flashback">
            <h3>FLASHBACK</h3>
            <p>I walk towards **D——**, his deep blue eyes searching for solace in mine. He complains of the cold snow and the warm rain, claiming they had no match in this unprecedented climate. Something felt odd about this day. He wanted me to leave the business and join him in the army as a surgeon. Persistent to show me what I was missing, he led me to the crime scene—a scene we shouldn't have been at, but the General had ordered him to investigate. We were to get married this week. The last thing I remember was the wailing of the sirens and the blood on my hands. The blood of my fiancé. Rushing him to the hospital, trying anything to save him. That last "I love you" broke my heart until I could hear nothing but silence. Absolute silence.</p>
        </div>

        <p>"I will handle it; don't you worry," **H——** concludes, and I soon begin to fade into the surreal silence of the hospital. That moment never faded.</p>
